    "<p>A classic real-life example of a normal distribution is the distribution of human heights in a population. Let's take a look at how this example fits the characteristics of a normal distribution:</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "- Many people in the population would have heights close to the mean height of 170 cm, making the curve peak at this point.\n",
    "- As you move away from the mean in either direction, the number of people with those heights decreases, creating the characteristic bell shape.\n",
    "- The spread of heights, determined by the standard deviation of around 10 cm, means that most people would fall within the range of 160 cm to 180 cm (approximately one standard deviation from the mean), and fewer people would be much shorter or taller than this range."

    "<p>In the short term, the behavior of a probability distribution can be quite variable due to the inherent randomness involved. This means that over a small number of trials or observations, individual outcomes may not necessarily follow the expected probabilities dictated by the distribution. However, as the number of trials grows, the behavior of the distribution becomes more predictable and consistent, aligning more closely with the expected probabilities.</p>"
