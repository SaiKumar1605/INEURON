    "<p>A bound method refers to a method that is associated with an instance of a class. When you access and call a method on an instance, the method is \"bound\" to that instance, meaning that the instance is implicitly passed as the first argument (usually named self) to the method.</p>\n"

    "\n",
    "<b style =\"color: #00b386\">Answer:</b> \n",
    "<p>In Python, the concept of \"pseudo-private\" attributes refers to a naming convention that makes instance variables appear private by using a double underscore prefix (__) before the variable name. However, this does not provide true encapsulation or access control like in some other programming languages. Instead, it performs name mangling, which slightly changes the name of the variable to make it less likely to clash with variables from derived classes or external code.</p>\n",
