    "<p>The relationship between a class and its instances in object-oriented programming can be described as a \"one-to-many\" relationship. In other words, a single class can be used to create multiple instances, each representing a distinct object with its own set of attributes and behaviors. This relationship is sometimes also referred to as a \"class-instance\" relationship.</p>\n",

The class \"Car\" is the blueprint, and each car instance is a separate object created based on that blueprint. </p>"
