    "Prior probability is the initial belief about the likelihood of an event before considering new evidence. It's based on existing information or historical data. For instance, if you believe that 10% of emails are spam based on past experience, that's your prior probability.

    "\n",
    "The Naïve Bayes classifier is a machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, used for classification tasks. It assumes that features (variables) are independent and have no direct influence on each other, which is a simplification but often works well in practice. The \"naïve\" aspect of its name comes from this assumption of independence, which is often overly simplistic, but the algorithm can still perform surprisingly well, especially for text classification tasks like spam detection or sentiment analysis."
