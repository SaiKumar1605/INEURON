    "The various central inclination measures include the mean, median, and mode. The mean can vary significantly from the median in datasets with outliers or skewed distributions because the mean is sensitive to extreme values, while the median is more robust as it's based on the middle value and not influenced by extreme observations."

    "A scatter plot visually displays bivariate relationships by plotting data points from two variables on a graph, showing patterns, trends, or correlations. Outliers can be identified in a scatter plot as points that deviate significantly from the general pattern, lying far from the cluster of other data points. They appear as points that are distant from the main cloud of points on the plot."
