    "The \"No Free Lunch\" theorem in machine learning states that there is no universally superior algorithm that performs best across all possible tasks. It implies that a model's effectiveness is tied to the specific problem it's applied to, and no single algorithm can be optimal for every problem. In essence, the performance of a machine learning algorithm depends on the characteristics of the problem domain it addresses."

    "\n",
    "1. **Data Partitioning:** The dataset is divided into K equally sized subsets or \"folds.\"\n",

    "3. **Model Evaluation:** The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set in each iteration. Performance metrics are recorded for each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance Aggregation:** After all K iterations, the recorded performance metrics are averaged or combined to provide an overall assessment of the model's performance. This technique helps estimate how well the model generalizes to unseen data and assists in hyperparameter tuning."

    "2. **R-squared:** Assess the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model; higher values indicate better fit.\n",
    "3. **Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Quantify the average prediction error; lower values indicate better predictive accuracy.\n",
    "4. **Coefficient Significance:** Evaluate the significance of coefficients using p-values; significant coefficients have an impact on the target variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **F-measurement (F1 Score):**\n",
    "   - A metric that balances precision and recall in classification tasks.\n",
    "   - F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",
    "   - Used when the balance between false positives and false negatives is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Silhouette Width:**\n",
    "   - A measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation).\n",
    "   - Ranges from -1 to +1, where higher values indicate better-defined clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve:**\n",
    "   - A graphical representation of a classification model's performance across different thresholds.\n",
    "   - Plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity).\n",
    "   - Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) quantifies the overall performance of the model; higher AUC indicates better discrimination ability."
